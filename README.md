# Heroku R Docker Image

This is the docker image for applications which use [R](http://www.r-project.org/) for statistical computing and [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) for R packages, running on [Heroku](https://heroku.com).

R is "GNU S", a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time series analysis, classification, clustering, etc. Please consult the [R project homepage](http://www.r-project.org/) for further information.

[CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/) is a network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for R.
